# DE-ZoomCamp 2025  
Welcome to my **Data Engineering ZoomCamp 2025** repository!  

This repository contains my notes, projects, and exercises as I participate in the **Data Engineering ZoomCamp** organized by [DataTalks Club](https://datatalks.club/). This hands-on training program is designed to build a strong foundation in data engineering and help participants work on real-world projects.  

## About the Program  
The Data Engineering ZoomCamp covers:  
- Building data pipelines  
- Setting up data storage solutions  
- Data transformation and processing  
- Using cloud platforms for data engineering  
- Following best practices in the field  

I'm part of the **2025 cohort**, and this repository documents my journey through the program.  

## Repository Structure  
Here’s how I’ve organized my work:  
- **Notes**: My personal notes on each session, including key concepts and takeaways.  
- **Code**: Scripts and projects I’ve developed during the program.  
- **Exercises**: Solutions to weekly assignments and challenges.  
- **Resources**: Links and additional material that I found helpful along the way.  

## My Journey  
I’m using this program to deepen my knowledge of data engineering and sharpen my technical skills. It’s been an incredible experience so far, and I’m excited to continue learning!
